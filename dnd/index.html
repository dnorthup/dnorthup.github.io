        <h2>LAST TIME ON D&D</h2>
            <p>I will begin writing and keeping this updated. Give me some time!</p>
            
            <P>Our players started on Kanabalt Isle, an island on the southwest part of the world. A human tyrant king rules over the land, continuously attampting to siege non-human encampments, towns, cities, and villages. Kas Hellbane, the king, came into power when his father, Victor, mysteriously disappeared. The king seemed to be mad, constantly obsessed with a prophecy told to him by a sage. "They will fall from the skies with no past to silently dethrone you. With little aide from the human race, you will be unable to fight back."
            <br><br>
            Two of our heroes where captured and trapped in Hellbane's Hold in the capital city of Shaonor. A sentinel sent from Evershroud was sent on a rescue mission and happened upon them. A half elf and a tabaxi were the only ones still alive and untortured. The sentinel, Calad, and the two heroes safely make it back to Evershroud with little trouble.</P>
