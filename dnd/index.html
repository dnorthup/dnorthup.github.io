        <h2>LAST TIME ON D&D</h2>
            <p>I will begin writing and keeping this updated. Give me some time!</p>
            
            <P><sub>Session 1</sub> Our players started on Kanabalt Isle, an island on the southwest part of the world. A human tyrant king rules over the land, continuously attampting to siege non-human encampments, towns, cities, and villages. Kas Hellbane, the king, came into power when his father, Victor, mysteriously disappeared. The king seemed to be mad, constantly obsessed with a prophecy told to him by a sage. "They will fall from the skies with no past to silently dethrone you. With little aide from the human race, you will be unable to fight back."
            <br><br>
            Two of our heroes where captured and trapped in Hellbane's Hold in the capital city of Shaonor. A sentinel sent from Evershroud was sent on a rescue mission and happened upon them. A half elf and a tabaxi were the only ones still alive and untortured. The sentinel, Calad, and the two heroes safely make it back to Evershroud with little trouble.</P>
            
            <p><sub>8/4/2018</sub> Some of our remaining heroes wake up in a graveyard ruin. After crawling out of graves and looking around, Li see's their long-time friend Phelaia and new companions Spark and Felix. While Maat is nowhere to be found, they do see an empty grave. After looking around the ruin for a bit they decide to look further around the area, finding out they are on a hellish wasteland island. Li finds a well and sees something sparkling at the bottom of it. Li calls out to their other companions, ties a rope off around the well and jumps in, forgetting to take the other end of the rope with them. While picking up the shiny object, which happens to be a key, Felix throws the other end of the rope down to Li. While all of this is happening, Phelaia grows bored of waiting and runs into a tower she had found on the west side of the island. Immediately upon entering, two wights clad in studded leather and holding longswords attempt to end her. She shouts for help and takes a few blows. After a while the rest of the party is there to help and dispatch the wights with great prejudice. After much investigation they determine this is a dark religious shrine and find a glowing orb at the top floor. A plaque above the orb reads "A flesh sacrifice is needed to weild this magic." After a few blood sacrifices, the party rereads the plaque. Li takes it upon themselves to cut off the last 4 inches of their tail and places it upon the offering plate. The orb stops glowing and Li picks it up. After arguing about the usefulness of the orb, they proceed back towards the ruins and down the only unexplored path. Using the key Li found in the well, they open a grand metal gate that was locked. Finding another tower, Felix goes stealth and enters, only to find a basilisk and sea hag waiting for him on the other side. They both spot him and begin to attack.</p>
